- [Cosmic](https://www.cosmicjs.com/) - A Headless CMS enables the independence of the data (content) layer and gives us the ability to quickly manage template content.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A performant utility-first CSS framework that can be composed directly in your markup.
