# Portfolio built with Next.js and Cosmic

To build this app, I have used the following technologies:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) - A React framework for production that makes it easy to spin up a full-stack application.
- [Cosmic](https://www.cosmicjs.com/) - A Headless CMS enables the independence of the data (content) layer and gives us the ability to quickly manage template content.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A performant utility-first CSS framework that can be composed directly in your markup.

## Getting started

Install the dependencies by running one of the following commands:

```
pnpm install
# or
yarn
# or
npm install
```

Then run the development server:

```
pnpm dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
```
